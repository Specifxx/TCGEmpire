    excerpt:
      "Thinking about picking up Riftbound: League of Legends TCG? An honest, hype-free look at what the game is, what it costs to start, and who it's for.",

    body: `Riftbound — the League of Legends Trading Card Game — is one of the newest TCGs around, and "should I get into it?" is the question we hear most. Here's an honest answer, without the hype.

## What you're actually getting

Riftbound is a strategy card game set in the League of Legends universe. You build a deck around a **Legend** (your champion), across the game's domains — Fury, Calm, Mind, Body, Chaos, Order and Colorless — and battle for control of battlefields. If you enjoy deckbuilding and tactical card games (or you already love League's characters), it lands in a very familiar, very satisfying place.

## The good

- **It's early.** Getting in now means learning the game as the community grows and the meta is still wide open — a genuinely fun time to play.
- **The IP is huge.** League's characters and art carry real appeal, and the card art is gorgeous.
- **You don't need to spend big to play.** Preconstructed decks and Proving Grounds kits give you a complete, playable deck cheaply.

## The honest caveats

- **It's a new game**, so the local scene depends on where you live — check whether stores near you run events before you go deep.
- **Like any TCG, it can get expensive** if you chase chase-cards. The good news: you rarely *need* them to play well.

## What it costs to start

The cheapest route in is a **preconstructed or Proving Grounds deck** — a ready-to-play deck out of the box. From there you upgrade card-by-card with **singles**, which is far cheaper than ripping boxes hoping to pull what you need. Want to know the real cost? Drop a decklist into our **[deck pricer](/deck)** and it totals every card at the cheapest live price.

## Who it's for

If you like building decks, enjoy League, or want to get into a TCG on the ground floor, Riftbound is an easy yes. If you only want a quick filler game with no collecting, it might be more than you're after.

## Try before you spend

You can get a feel for the cards completely free: play **[Riftle](/riftle)**, our daily card game, print test decks with the **[proxy tool](/proxy)**, and read **[Riftbound for beginners](/guides/riftbound-for-beginners)**. When you're ready to buy, **[compare every store](/browse)** so you start out paying the least.`,

    body: `It's the eternal TCG question: do you buy the **singles** you need, or open **packs** and chase them? Here's how to decide — every time.

## The case for singles

If you want **specific cards** — to finish a deck, complete a playset, or grab a chase card — buying singles is almost always cheaper than opening packs to find them. You pay for exactly what you want, with zero variance. Look any card up on the **[database](/browse)** and buy the cheapest copy across stores.

## The case for packs

Opening packs is **fun** — the rip, the chase, the surprise. Packs and boxes also make sense if you want to draft, collect sealed product, or you genuinely enjoy the gamble. Just go in knowing the expected value: on average a box returns less than the sum of the singles inside, because you're paying for the experience.

## The maths in one line

A booster box has a fixed *expected value* spread across many random cards. If you need a few particular cards, you'll usually pay **less** buying those singles directly than opening boxes hoping to hit them. Curious about a specific set? Our **[Box EV calculator](/tools/box-ev)** works out a box's expected value from live singles prices, so you can see whether opening is +EV before you buy.

## A simple rule of thumb

- **Building or upgrading a deck?** → Buy **[singles](/browse)**.
- **Want the opening experience, to draft, or to collect sealed?** → Buy a box — and **[compare box prices first](/sealed)**.
- **Not sure?** → Run the **[Box EV calculator](/tools/box-ev)** and let the numbers decide.

Either way, the smart move is the same: compare prices before you spend. That's the whole reason RiftCompare exists.`,

    excerpt:
      "Sleeves, top-loaders, binders and boxes — a plain-English guide to keeping your Riftbound cards (and their value) in mint condition.",
    author: "RiftCompare",
    date: "2026-06-12",
    readMins: 5,
    tags: ["collecting", "guide", "condition", "storage"],
    body: `A Riftbound card's condition is a big part of its value — a Near Mint copy can be worth far more than a played one. Here's how to protect your cards properly, whether you're holding a chase card or just keeping a deck tidy.

## Why condition matters

Prices on RiftCompare assume **Near Mint (NM)** — the benchmark condition. As cards pick up whitening, scratches, dents or bends they drop through Lightly Played, Moderately Played, Heavily Played and Damaged, and each step down means a lower price. Protecting a card is the cheapest way to protect its value.

## The basics: sleeves

Every card you care about should be in a **sleeve**. There are two main types:

- **Penny sleeves** — cheap, thin, soft plastic. Perfect as a first layer for storage and bulk.
- **Deck sleeves** — sturdier, often coloured or art-printed, made for shuffling and play. If you're actually playing with a deck, these are what you want.

For valuable cards, the collector standard is **double-sleeving**: a snug "perfect fit" inner sleeve, then a standard sleeve over the top, so dust and moisture can't creep in.

## For valuable singles: top-loaders & one-touches

- **Top-loaders** are rigid plastic holders that stop a sleeved card from bending — ideal for posting cards or storing your best singles.
- **Magnetic "one-touch" holders** are premium display cases for your grails (signatures, chase alt-arts). Make sure you buy the right thickness for foils or thicker cards.

Never put an unsleeved card straight into a top-loader — the card can rub against the plastic.

## For collections: binders & boxes

- **Binders** with side-loading pockets are great for sets and showing off a collection. Avoid old PVC binders (they can damage cards over time) — look for acid-free, side-loading pages.
- **Storage/deck boxes** keep bulk and built decks organised. Keep everything somewhere cool, dry and out of direct sunlight — heat and UV fade cards and warp foils.

## Foils need extra care

Foil cards are more prone to **curving** as the foil layer reacts to humidity. Double-sleeving helps them lie flat, and storing them under light, even pressure (in a packed binder page or a tight box) keeps them straight.

## Quick checklist

- Sleeve everything you care about; double-sleeve the good stuff.
- Top-loader or one-touch for valuable singles and anything you post.
- Acid-free, side-loading binders for sets; cool, dry, dark storage.
- Keep foils flat and away from humidity.

Looking after your cards keeps them at the condition our prices assume — so when you check a card's value on the **[database](/browse)**, that's the value you'll actually get. New to buying? Start with **[where to buy Riftbound cards](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)**.`,

    excerpt:
      "Common to Showcase, alt-arts, Signatures, Overnumbered and promos — what every Riftbound rarity and special printing means, and why it changes the price.",
    author: "RiftCompare",
    date: "2026-06-11",
    readMins: 5,
    tags: ["collecting", "guide", "rarity", "printings"],
    body: `Two copies of the "same" Riftbound card can have very different prices — because they're different *printings*. Here's how rarity and special treatments work, so you always know exactly what you're buying.

## The rarity ladder

Every base Riftbound card has a rarity, shown on RiftCompare with a coloured badge:

- **Common** — the backbone of the set; cheap and plentiful.
- **Uncommon** — a step up in scarcity.
- **Rare** — less common, often deck staples.
- **Epic** — scarcer still, and home to many chase cards.
- **Showcase** — special alternate-art treatments; the rarest pulls and usually the priciest.

Higher rarity generally means a higher price, but **playability** matters too — a Rare that defines the meta can cost more than an Epic nobody plays.

## Special printings (and how we label them)

Beyond rarity, the same card can appear in several printings. RiftCompare labels each one right in the card name so you're never guessing:

- **Alt Art** — an alternate-artwork version of a card (collector numbers like *112a*). Plays identically to the base card; priced as a collectible.
- **Showcase** — the premium alt-art treatment (see above).
- **Signature** — artist-signed, "overnumbered" cards marked with a *★* in the collector number (e.g. *223★/221*). Among the rarest cards in the game.
- **Overnumbered** — cards numbered beyond the set's base count (e.g. *238/219*) — special chase pulls.
- **Promo** — limited printings from prereleases, organised play and events. A promo shares the base card's art and number but trades at its own price.

## Why the same card has multiple prices

Because each printing is, to a collector, a different card. The **base print** is what you want for a deck — it plays the same and costs the least. The fancy versions (alt-art, Signature, promo) cost more because they're scarcer, not because they're better in play. On any **[card page](/browse)** the printing is spelled out in the title, so you can pick exactly the version you mean to buy.

## The practical takeaway

- **Building a deck?** Buy the cheapest base print — it plays identically.
- **Collecting?** Decide which treatment you're chasing (alt-art, Signature, promo) and confirm the label before you buy.
- **Selling?** Make sure you list the right printing — mixing them up is the most common pricing mistake.

    body: `Riftbound card prices are never still. A card that defines a winning deck at the weekend can jump 30% by Monday; a reprint or a cooling meta can send another sliding. If you buy and sell singles, knowing **which way prices are moving** is half the battle — and we built a page to show you exactly that.

## Track the movers in one place

Head to the **[Price Movers page](/movers)** to see, for your region, this week's:

- **📈 Biggest risers** — the cards spiking up the most over the last 7 days.
- **📉 Biggest drops** — the singles that have fallen the most, often the best time to buy.
- **💎 Best value right now** — cards trading furthest below their recent high.

Every figure is the live local price in your currency (AUD, NZD, USD or GBP), compared across the stores we track and updated daily. Switch your country at the top of the page to see your market's movers.

## Why prices move

- **The metagame.** When a deck starts winning events, demand for its key cards spikes. Watch the **[meta decks page](/decks)** and you'll often see a card climb right after a strong tournament weekend.
- **Supply.** New set releases, restocks and reprints add supply and usually cool prices; cards that stop being printed drift up.
- **Hype and spoilers.** Anticipation for an upcoming set can move prices on related cards before a single pack is opened.

## How to use this as a buyer

- **Buying to play?** Check the drops and best-value lists first — you'll often find the card you need is cheaper than it was a week ago.
- **Completing a set or chasing a grail?** Set a price alert: tap the heart on any card to get an email when it falls.
- **Always compare delivered cost.** A spiking headline price still varies store to store — open the card to see every shop ranked cheapest-first.

## How to use this as a seller

If you have cards sitting in a binder, the risers list tells you what's worth listing right now. Post them on the **[forum](/forum)** or, if you're a verified seller, in the **[marketplace](/marketplace)** while demand is hot.

    body: `**Vendetta (VEN)** is the next set on the Riftbound: League of Legends TCG release calendar, following Origins, Proving Grounds, Spirit Forged and Unleashed. It isn't out yet — but a new set is the single biggest event for card prices, so it pays to be ready before launch day.

## Track Vendetta on RiftCompare

We've already set up the **[Vendetta set page](/sets/vendetta)**. The moment cards are released, every VEN single will appear there with live prices compared across stores — so you can find the cheapest copy of any new card from day one, in your local currency.

## What a new set means for prices

- **Launch-day volatility.** Sealed product and the first chase singles tend to spike at release when supply is tight, then settle over the following weeks as stock catches up. If you're not in a rush, waiting often saves money.
- **Meta shake-up.** New cards reshape the **[metagame](/decks)**. Cards that enable a strong new deck can climb fast — keep an eye on the **[price movers](/movers)** in the weeks after release.
- **Ripple effects on older sets.** A new set can raise demand for older cards that combo with it, and cool cards it replaces.

## How to be ready

1. **Wishlist now.** Browse the **[card database](/browse)** and wishlist the cards you already know you want — you'll get an email if a price drops.
2. **Compare sealed early.** When VEN booster boxes and packs list, the **[sealed page](/sealed)** will rank them cheapest-first across stores. Boxes move quickly at launch.
3. **Have your deck ready to price.** Drop your planned list into the **[deck builder](/deck)** so you can re-price it the moment the new cards go live.
4. **Don't overpay in the rush.** Launch hype pushes prices up; RiftCompare always shows you the cheapest delivered price so you never pay the first number you see.

We'll update the **[Vendetta page](/sets/vendetta)** and post a meta snapshot here on the blog as the set lands. In the meantime, **[browse the current sets](/browse)** or read **[where to buy Riftbound cards](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)** to get familiar with how it all works.`,

    body: `Got a stack of Riftbound cards gathering dust — duplicates, cards from a deck you've moved on from, or pulls you don't need? Here's how to turn them into cash (or store credit) and get a fair price.

## 1. Price your cards accurately first

Before you list anything, find out what your cards are actually worth **today**. Look each one up on the **[card database](/browse)** to see its live price across every store we track. A few things to get right:

- **The exact printing.** Base, alt-art, Showcase, Signature, Overnumbered and promo versions all trade at very different prices. RiftCompare labels each printing in the card name so you can match yours precisely.
- **Condition.** Near Mint (NM) is the benchmark; lightly to heavily played copies sell for less. Be honest — it builds trust and avoids returns.
- **Which cards are worth listing now.** Check the **[price movers](/movers)** — if one of your cards is spiking this week, that's the one to list first.

## 2. Choose where to sell

- **The RiftCompare forum.** Post a free **want-to-sell** listing on the **[forum](/forum)** — it reaches players actively looking to buy, with no listing fees. Great for singles, bulk and trades.
- **The RiftCompare marketplace.** If you sell regularly, becoming a **[verified seller](/marketplace)** puts your listings right inside the price comparison, in front of buyers at the moment they're choosing where to buy.
- **eBay and local stores.** For high-value chase cards, a wider audience can help — just factor in fees and postage when you compare your net.

## 3. Set a competitive price

The cards that sell fastest are the ones priced at or just under the cheapest comparable listing. Open the card on RiftCompare, see the lowest current price, and pitch yours accordingly:

- **Want a fast sale?** Undercut the cheapest in-stock listing slightly.
- **Not in a hurry?** Price at market and wait — especially if the card is trending up.
- **Selling a whole deck?** Price it as a bundle with the **[deck pricer](/deck)** so buyers can see the value at a glance.

## 4. Ship smart and build a reputation

- Use a rigid mailer and a sleeve + top-loader so cards arrive in the condition you described.
- Post quickly and communicate — repeat buyers come from good experiences.
- Bundle small cards together so postage doesn't eat the value of a cheap sale.

    body: `Getting into Riftbound: League of Legends TCG is exciting — but it's easy to overspend when you're new. Here are the five mistakes we see most often, and how to dodge every one.

## 1. Buying from the first store you find

The same Riftbound card can cost wildly different amounts from shop to shop, and stock changes daily. Buying from the first store you land on is the quickest way to overpay. Instead, **[search the card database](/browse)** and you'll see the lowest live price across every store we track, sorted cheapest-first, with a one-click link straight to the shop.

## 2. Ignoring shipping

A card that's 50c cheaper isn't a deal if it adds postage from a separate store. Always compare the **delivered** cost, not just the sticker price — RiftCompare shows an estimated shipping figure per shop, and buying several cards from one store often unlocks free shipping and beats splitting your order across three.

## 3. Buying the wrong printing

Alt-art, Showcase, Signature, Overnumbered and promo versions of a card can cost many times more than the base print — and they play identically. If you just want the card for your deck, buy the cheap base version. RiftCompare labels each printing right in the card name, so you always know exactly which one you're adding to cart.

## 4. Ripping boxes hoping to pull what you need

Opening booster boxes is fun, but if you need **specific** cards to finish a deck, buying those singles directly is almost always cheaper than chasing them in packs. Save sealed for when you want the opening experience or to collect — and even then, **[compare box prices](/sealed)** first. See our breakdown: **[singles vs sealed](/guides/riftbound-singles-vs-sealed)**.

## 5. Overpaying during hype spikes

Prices jump around tournaments and new-set launches. Paying the first (inflated) number you see during a spike is a classic beginner trap. Check the **[price movers](/movers)** to see whether a card is riding a spike or sitting at a fair price, and set a price alert (tap the heart on any card) to get an email when it drops back down.

## The one habit that fixes all five

Compare before you buy. Set your country at the top of the page, **[open the card database](/browse)**, look up what you want, and click through to the cheapest store. Do that every time and you'll build the same collection for a lot less.

Whether you're chasing a single chase card, completing a deck, or grabbing a sealed booster box, this guide covers exactly **where to buy Riftbound cards** in **Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom** — and how to make sure you never overpay.

The short version: prices for the same card vary a lot between shops and change daily, so the smartest move is to **[compare every store at once on RiftCompare](/browse)** and buy from whichever is cheapest in your country. Here's how to do it region by region.

## How to find the cheapest Riftbound card price

1. **[Search the card database](/browse)** and open the card you want.
2. Each card shows the **lowest live price across every store we track**, sorted cheapest-first, with a one-click link straight to the shop.
3. Use the **country switcher** (top of the page) to set your region — prices then show in your local currency (AUD, NZD, USD or GBP), sourced from local stores, so what you see is what you'll actually pay.

You can also **[price a whole deck at once](/deck)** or **[compare sealed products](/sealed)** like booster boxes and Proving Grounds.

## 🇦🇺 Buying Riftbound cards in Australia

Australia has a healthy spread of Riftbound retailers — dedicated TCG shops, hobby stores and local game stores (LGS) — plus eBay Australia for harder-to-find singles. Because postage and stock differ wildly between shops, the cheapest *delivered* price is rarely the first shop you check.

- **Singles:** [Browse the card database](/browse) with the country set to **Australia** to see the lowest AUD price across Australian stores and eBay AU.
- **Sealed:** booster boxes, packs and Proving Grounds kits are on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** many AU stores offer free shipping over a threshold — buying a few cards from one shop can beat splitting an order across three.

## 🇳🇿 Buying Riftbound cards in New Zealand

New Zealand's Riftbound scene is growing fast, with several Kiwi TCG stores stocking singles in NZD. Buying locally avoids international shipping and currency surprises.

- Set the country switcher to **New Zealand** and **[browse singles](/browse)** to compare live NZD prices across NZ stores.
- For boxes and packs, check the **[sealed products page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** NZ stock can be thinner than AU/US for rare cards — wishlist the ones you want so you're ready when they're listed.

## 🇺🇸 Buying Riftbound cards in the United States

The US is the deepest Riftbound market by far — thousands of in-stock singles across dozens of stores, plus eBay US and the big marketplaces. That depth means the best deals are out there, but only if you compare.

- Switch the country to the **United States** and **[search the database](/browse)** for live USD prices across US stores, eBay US and major marketplaces.
- Sealed product (booster boxes, cases, Proving Grounds) is on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** for high-value chase cards, condition matters — we surface Near-Mint English prices so you're comparing like for like, not a cheaper played or foreign-language copy.

## 🇬🇧 Buying Riftbound cards in the United Kingdom

UK players can buy Riftbound singles in GBP from a growing list of British TCG retailers, with eBay UK filling the gaps. Buying from UK stores avoids customs and import fees.

- Set the country to the **United Kingdom** and **[browse singles](/browse)** for live GBP prices across UK stores and eBay UK.
- **[Sealed products](/sealed)** are listed too.
- **Tip:** the UK singles market is still maturing, so for some cards a converted reference price is shown until a genuine in-stock GBP listing appears — always confirm on the retailer's page before buying.

## Singles vs sealed: which should you buy?

- **Buying specific cards** (to finish a deck or grab a chase card)? Buy **singles** — it's almost always cheaper than ripping packs and chasing the card you need. Start on the **[card database](/browse)**.
- **Want the opening experience, or to invest/collect?** Buy **sealed** — booster boxes and Proving Grounds. Compare box prices on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.

## Tips for buying Riftbound cards safely

- **Compare delivered cost, not just the sticker price** — shipping can flip which store is cheapest.
- **Check the condition** — Near Mint (NM) is standard; played copies should cost less.
- **Watch for the right printing** — alt-art, Showcase, Signature, Overnumbered and promo versions all trade at different prices, so make sure you're buying the exact one you want.
- **Buy the English print** unless you specifically want another language — non-English copies are cheaper but aren't the same card.

- **If you want specific cards** (to finish a deck or grab a chase card), **[buying singles](/browse) is almost always cheaper** than ripping boxes hoping to pull them.
- **If you want the opening experience, to draft, or to collect/invest**, a sealed box is the way — just buy it at the best price.

## Tips before you buy a box

- **Check the price history feel** — box prices often spike at launch and settle later; if you're not in a rush, waiting can save money.
- **Factor in shipping** — a slightly dearer box with free postage can beat a cheaper one plus delivery.
- **Buy from reputable stockists** — we link straight to each store so you can check their returns and shipping policy.

    body: `Every **Riftbound: League of Legends TCG** set has its chase cards — the ones collectors and players pay a premium for. This guide explains **what makes a Riftbound card valuable** and how to find the most expensive cards and check their live price.

## See the most valuable cards right now

The fastest way to spot the chase cards is to **[browse the card database](/browse)** and sort by price (high to low). That surfaces the current most-valuable Riftbound singles in your region, with live prices across every store we track.

## What makes a Riftbound card valuable?

- **Rarity** — Epic and **Showcase** cards are scarcer than Commons and Uncommons, so they command higher prices.
- **Alt-art printings** — alternate-art versions (collector numbers like *120a*) of popular cards are prized by collectors.
- **Signature cards** — artist-signed, overnumbered "Signature" printings are some of the rarest pulls in the game.
- **Overnumbered / secret cards** — cards numbered beyond the set's base count are special chase pulls.
- **Promos** — organized-play, prerelease and Nexus Night promo printings are limited and often sought-after.
- **Playability** — a card that defines the **[current meta](/decks)** holds value because players need playsets of it.

On RiftCompare, each of these printings is labelled in the card's name (e.g. *(Alt Art)*, *(Signature)*, *(Promo)*) so you always know exactly which version you're looking at.

## Buying and selling chase cards safely

- **Compare across stores** — high-value cards have the widest price spread, so comparing saves the most here. Open any card to see **every store's price** sorted cheapest-first.
- **Mind the condition** — Near Mint (NM) is the benchmark; played copies should cost noticeably less.
- **Buy the English print** unless you specifically want another language — foreign copies are cheaper but aren't the same card.
- **Check the exact printing** — make sure you're buying the alt-art / signature / promo you actually want, not the base card (or vice versa).

Want to find your grail? **[Browse every Riftbound card](/browse)** and sort by price, or read our **[guide to where to buy Riftbound cards](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)** for the best place to buy in your region.`,

    body: `**Riftbound** is the **League of Legends Trading Card Game** from Riot Games (published in English by UVS Games). If you're brand new, here's how to start playing — and exactly what to buy first without overspending.

## What is Riftbound?

Riftbound is a collectible card game set in the League of Legends universe. You build a deck around a **Legend** (your champion) using cards across the game's domains — **Fury, Calm, Mind, Body, Chaos, Order** and Colorless — and card types like **Units, Spells, Gear, Runes and Battlefields**. Sets so far include **Origins (OGN)**, **Proving Grounds**, **Spirit Forged (SFD)** and **Unleashed (UNL)**.

## The easiest way to start

1. **Grab a ready-to-play product.** A preconstructed deck or a Proving Grounds kit gives you a complete, playable deck out of the box — the cheapest way in. Compare prices on the **[sealed products page](/sealed)**.
2. **Learn the deck**, then upgrade it card-by-card with **[singles](/browse)** — far cheaper than buying booster boxes hoping to pull what you need.
3. **Find the cheapest copies** with RiftCompare — see our **[where to buy Riftbound cards guide](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)**.

## What to buy first (on a budget)

- **A preconstructed / Proving Grounds deck** — instant playability.
- **A handful of singles** to upgrade weak spots — look up exact prices on the **[card database](/browse)**.
- **Skip the chase cards at first** — alt-arts and Signatures look great but aren't needed to play well.

## Tips for new players

- **Want to test a deck before buying?** Print proxies with the **[proxy sheet tool](/proxy)**, then buy the real cards once you've settled on a list.
- **Browse the meta** on the **[decks page](/decks)** to see what top players run — and what it costs to build.

    body: `Should you buy **Riftbound** singles or sealed booster boxes? It depends on your goal. Here's a simple breakdown to help you spend wisely.

## Buy singles when…

- You want **specific cards** to build or finish a deck.
- You're chasing a particular **alt-art, Signature or promo** card.
- You want the **cheapest path** to a competitive deck — buying the exact cards you need almost always beats ripping boxes.

Look up any card's live price across stores on the **[card database](/browse)**, and price a whole list at once with the **[deck pricer](/deck)**.

## Buy sealed when…

- You enjoy the **opening experience** or want to draft.
- You're **collecting or investing** and want unopened product.
- You're after the occasional **chase pull** and don't mind the variance.

Compare booster box and pack prices on the **[sealed products page](/sealed)** — see our **[cheapest booster boxes guide](/guides/cheapest-riftbound-booster-boxes)**.

## The value reality

A booster box has a fixed expected value spread across many cards. If you only need a few specific cards, you'll usually pay **less by buying those singles directly** than by opening boxes and hoping. If you value the experience or want everything sealed, boxes win. There's no wrong answer — just buy whichever at the best price, which is exactly what RiftCompare is for.

## Bottom line

- **Building a deck?** → **[Buy singles](/browse).**
- **Opening / collecting / investing?** → **[Buy sealed](/sealed).**

Either way, **compare prices first** — see **[where to buy Riftbound cards](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)**.`,

    body: `You don't need a huge budget to play **Riftbound** competitively. Here's how to build a strong deck cheaply — and price it before you buy.

## Start from a known list

The quickest budget route is to start from a proven decklist and trim the expensive cards. Browse current **[meta and preconstructed decks](/decks)** — each shows a **live build cost** so you can see what a deck costs in your region before committing.

## Price your deck before you buy

Paste any decklist into the **[deck pricer](/deck)** and it matches every card to its cheapest live price across stores, then totals it up. Tweak the list, re-price, and watch the cost drop — the fastest way to find the cheapest version of a deck.

## Budget-building tips

- **Lean on Commons and Uncommons** — they do most of the work for a fraction of chase-rare prices.
- **Use base printings, not alt-arts** — the base card plays identically for far less. RiftCompare labels each printing in the card name so you can pick the cheap base version on the **[card database](/browse)**.
- **Buy singles, not boxes** — for a specific list, singles are almost always cheaper.
- **Consolidate orders** — buying several cards from one store can unlock free shipping and beat splitting an order.
- **Test before you buy** — print a deck with the **[proxy sheet tool](/proxy)**, make sure you like it, then buy the real cards.

## Then find the cheapest cards

Once you've locked a list, **[search the database](/browse)** for each card and buy from whichever store is cheapest — or read our **[where to buy Riftbound cards guide](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)** for the best option in your region.

Build smart, compare prices, and you'll have a competitive Riftbound deck without overspending.`,

Riftbound is exciting, but tracking down the cheapest copy of a card across a dozen different stores is tedious — every shop prices differently, stock changes daily, and overseas sites quietly show you the wrong currency. We built RiftCompare to do that legwork for you.

## What you can do here

- **[Browse the card database](/browse)** — every Riftbound card, with the lowest live price across Australian stores.
- **[Compare sealed products](/sealed)** — booster boxes, packs, Proving Grounds and more, priced across shops.
- **[Explore meta decks](/decks)** — real top-finishing tournament lists, with a live "build cost" so you know what it costs to assemble.
- **[Buy & sell on the forum](/forum)** — post want-to-buy / want-to-sell listings and trade directly with other AU collectors.

## How prices work

We pull live prices from public Australian store feeds (and eBay AU) and always request the **Australian price**, so what you see is what you'd actually pay locally. Each card links straight out to the cheapest store so you can buy in a couple of clicks.

- **Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman** (Body/Calm) — the defining aggro-tempo deck: cheap units backed by combat tricks to close games fast.
- **Irelia, Blade Dancer** (Calm/Chaos) — flexible tempo with a deep spell package that snowballs the board.
- **LeBlanc, Deceiver** (Mind/Order) — go-wide midrange that floods cheap units and converts with value.

## Tier 2 — strong and popular

- **Diana, Scorn of the Moon** (Chaos/Mind) — spell-tempo built around burst finishers like Moonfall.
- **Fiora, Grand Duelist** (Body/Order) — wide, aggressive units that duel down blockers and race.
- **Vex, Gloomist** (Calm/Chaos) — evasive threats plus a deep trick suite to dominate combat.

    readMins: 4,
    tags: ["beginner", "deckbuilding"],
    body: `New to Riftbound deckbuilding? A constructed deck is made of a few distinct parts. Here's how the current tournament lists are put together.

## The parts of a deck

- **Legend (1)** — your identity card. It sets your deck's direction and which Champion you build around (e.g. *Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman*).
- **Champion (1)** — your signature unit, tied to your legend (e.g. *Master Yi, Tempered*).
- **Main deck (~40 cards)** — your **Units**, **Gear** and **Spells**. This is where most of your strategy lives.
- **Runes (12)** — your resource cards. Their colours must match your deck's **domains**.
- **Battlefields (3)** — the locations you contest during the game.
- **Sideboard (up to 8)** — extra cards you can swap in between games at tournaments.

Add it up and a full tournament list is **64 cards** (56 in the main deck plus the sideboard).

## Domains and runes

Riftbound has seven domains — **Fury, Calm, Mind, Body, Chaos, Order** and **Colorless**. Most competitive decks commit to **one or two** domains (for example *Master Yi* is Body/Calm, while *Irelia* is Calm/Chaos). Your 12 runes are split to match those domains, which is how you reliably cast your cards.

## Building on a budget

A deck's cost is dominated by a handful of chase cards — the commons, runes and battlefields are cheap. On every **[meta deck page](/decks)** we show the build cost broken down card-by-card and priced across Australian stores, so you can see exactly where the money goes and where to save. Want to tweak a list? Open it in the **[Deck Builder](/deck)** to re-price your own version.

## Mulligan: keep or ship your opening hand

After you draw your opening hand you get one chance to mulligan — shuffle back any number of cards and redraw that many. A good keep usually has:

- **Enough runes to cast your early plays** — a hand with no resources, or all resources and no spells, is a mulligan.
- **Something to do on your first few turns** — a cheap unit or a tempo spell so you're not passing turns.
- **A plan that matches your domains** — if your runes can't cast the expensive cards in hand, ship the dead weight.

Against aggressive decks, keep cheap blockers and removal; against slower decks, you can keep a slightly greedier hand with your stronger mid-game cards.

## Sideboarding between games

At tournaments you play best-of-three, and between games you can swap up to your full sideboard (8 cards) in and out. The idea is to tune your deck to the matchup: bring in extra removal against go-wide decks, more resilient threats against control, or anti-aggro tools when you're on the back foot. Plan your swaps **before** the event — for each common matchup, decide which cards come out and which come in, so you're not guessing at the table.

Want to test these ideas without buying in first? Print a list with the **[proxy sheet tool](/proxy)**, practise your mulligans and sideboard plan, then **[price the final deck](/deck)** and buy the cheapest copies across stores.`,

## Singles vs sealed

- **Singles** are individual cards — the cheapest way to get exactly what your deck needs. Browse them in our **[card database](/browse)**, where each card shows the lowest live AU price and links straight to the store.
- **Sealed** product (booster boxes, packs, Proving Grounds, Nexus Night packs) is better for opening and collecting. Compare it on the **[Sealed Products page](/sealed)**.

## Why our prices are accurate for Australia

Many overseas-hosted stores quietly show prices in the wrong currency depending on where their server thinks you are. We always request the **Australian** price from each store, so the numbers you see are what you'd actually pay locally — no surprise currency conversion at checkout.

## Tips for the cheapest basket

1. **Check the build cost on a deck page.** It already finds the cheapest copy of each card across every store we track.
2. **Watch shipping.** A card that's 20c cheaper isn't a win if it adds postage from a separate store — we show an estimated shipping figure per shop.
3. **Use the [forum](/forum).** Other AU players list cards for sale (often below retail), and you can post a want-to-buy for anything you're chasing.

We currently compare a wide range of Australian stores plus eBay AU, and we add more regularly. If your favourite shop is missing, let us know via [contact](/contact) — this guide will grow as coverage does.`,
