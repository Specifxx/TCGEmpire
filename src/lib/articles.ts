    body: `Want to buy **Riftbound: League of Legends TCG** cards but not sure where to start? Whether you're chasing a single chase card, completing a deck, or grabbing a sealed booster box, this guide covers exactly **where to buy Riftbound cards** in **Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom** — and how to make sure you never overpay.

The short version: prices for the same card vary a lot between shops and change daily, so the smartest move is to **[compare every store at once on RiftCompare](/browse)** and buy from whichever is cheapest in your country. Here's how to do it region by region.

## How to find the cheapest Riftbound card price

1. **[Search the card database](/browse)** and open the card you want.
2. Each card shows the **lowest live price across every store we track**, sorted cheapest-first, with a one-click link straight to the shop.
3. Use the **country switcher** (top of the page) to set your region — prices then show in your local currency (AUD, NZD, USD or GBP), sourced from local stores, so what you see is what you'll actually pay.

You can also **[price a whole deck at once](/deck)** or **[compare sealed products](/sealed)** like booster boxes and Proving Grounds.

## 🇦🇺 Buying Riftbound cards in Australia

Australia has a healthy spread of Riftbound retailers — dedicated TCG shops, hobby stores and local game stores (LGS) — plus eBay Australia for harder-to-find singles. Because postage and stock differ wildly between shops, the cheapest *delivered* price is rarely the first shop you check.

- **Singles:** [Browse the card database](/browse) with the country set to **Australia** to see the lowest AUD price across Australian stores and eBay AU.
- **Sealed:** booster boxes, packs and Proving Grounds kits are on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** many AU stores offer free shipping over a threshold — buying a few cards from one shop can beat splitting an order across three.

## 🇳🇿 Buying Riftbound cards in New Zealand

New Zealand's Riftbound scene is growing fast, with several Kiwi TCG stores stocking singles in NZD. Buying locally avoids international shipping and currency surprises.

- Set the country switcher to **New Zealand** and **[browse singles](/browse)** to compare live NZD prices across NZ stores.
- For boxes and packs, check the **[sealed products page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** NZ stock can be thinner than AU/US for rare cards — wishlist the ones you want so you're ready when they're listed.

## 🇺🇸 Buying Riftbound cards in the United States

The US is the deepest Riftbound market by far — thousands of in-stock singles across dozens of stores, plus eBay US and the big marketplaces. That depth means the best deals are out there, but only if you compare.

- Switch the country to the **United States** and **[search the database](/browse)** for live USD prices across US stores, eBay US and major marketplaces.
- Sealed product (booster boxes, cases, Proving Grounds) is on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.
- **Tip:** for high-value chase cards, condition matters — we surface Near-Mint English prices so you're comparing like for like, not a cheaper played or foreign-language copy.

## 🇬🇧 Buying Riftbound cards in the United Kingdom

UK players can buy Riftbound singles in GBP from a growing list of British TCG retailers, with eBay UK filling the gaps. Buying from UK stores avoids customs and import fees.

- Set the country to the **United Kingdom** and **[browse singles](/browse)** for live GBP prices across UK stores and eBay UK.
- **[Sealed products](/sealed)** are listed too.
- **Tip:** the UK singles market is still maturing, so for some cards a converted reference price is shown until a genuine in-stock GBP listing appears — always confirm on the retailer's page before buying.

## Singles vs sealed: which should you buy?

- **Buying specific cards** (to finish a deck or grab a chase card)? Buy **singles** — it's almost always cheaper than ripping packs and chasing the card you need. Start on the **[card database](/browse)**.
- **Want the opening experience, or to invest/collect?** Buy **sealed** — booster boxes and Proving Grounds. Compare box prices on the **[sealed page](/sealed)**.

## Tips for buying Riftbound cards safely

- **Compare delivered cost, not just the sticker price** — shipping can flip which store is cheapest.
- **Check the condition** — Near Mint (NM) is standard; played copies should cost less.
- **Watch for the right printing** — alt-art, Showcase, Signature, Overnumbered and promo versions all trade at different prices, so make sure you're buying the exact one you want.
- **Buy the English print** unless you specifically want another language — non-English copies are cheaper but aren't the same card.

## Ready to buy?

Set your country, **[open the card database](/browse)**, find your card, and click through to the cheapest store. New to Riftbound? Browse our other **[guides](/guides)** or check the current **[meta decks](/decks)** to see what's worth building.`,

    body: `Booster boxes are the most exciting — and most expensive — way to buy into **Riftbound: League of Legends TCG**. But box prices swing a lot between shops and over time, so before you buy, it pays to compare. This guide covers **where to find the cheapest Riftbound booster boxes** and sealed product in **Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom**.

## Compare every sealed price in one place

Head to the **[sealed products page](/sealed)** to see live prices for booster boxes, booster packs, Proving Grounds kits and other sealed Riftbound product across the stores we track — sorted so the cheapest is easy to spot. Set the **country switcher** to your region first so prices show in your local currency (AUD, NZD, USD or GBP).

## By region

- **🇦🇺 Australia:** Riftbound boxes sell out fast at launch — compare AUD prices across Australian stores on the **[sealed page](/sealed)** and watch for restocks.
- **🇳🇿 New Zealand:** fewer stockists than AU, so comparing NZD prices is the easiest way to avoid overpaying.
- **🇺🇸 United States:** the deepest market — the most competitive box pricing is usually here. Compare USD prices and check shipping.
- **🇬🇧 United Kingdom:** UK retailers price sealed in GBP; buying domestically avoids import duty.

## Booster box vs singles: which is better value?

- **If you want specific cards** (to finish a deck or grab a chase card), **[buying singles](/browse) is almost always cheaper** than ripping boxes hoping to pull them.
- **If you want the opening experience, to draft, or to collect/invest**, a sealed box is the way — just buy it at the best price.

## Tips before you buy a box

- **Check the price history feel** — box prices often spike at launch and settle later; if you're not in a rush, waiting can save money.
- **Factor in shipping** — a slightly dearer box with free postage can beat a cheaper one plus delivery.
- **Buy from reputable stockists** — we link straight to each store so you can check their returns and shipping policy.

    body: `Every **Riftbound: League of Legends TCG** set has its chase cards — the ones collectors and players pay a premium for. This guide explains **what makes a Riftbound card valuable** and how to find the most expensive cards and check their live price.

## See the most valuable cards right now

The fastest way to spot the chase cards is to **[browse the card database](/browse)** and sort by price (high to low). That surfaces the current most-valuable Riftbound singles in your region, with live prices across every store we track.

## What makes a Riftbound card valuable?

- **Rarity** — Epic and **Showcase** cards are scarcer than Commons and Uncommons, so they command higher prices.
- **Alt-art printings** — alternate-art versions (collector numbers like *120a*) of popular cards are prized by collectors.
- **Signature cards** — artist-signed, overnumbered "Signature" printings are some of the rarest pulls in the game.
- **Overnumbered / secret cards** — cards numbered beyond the set's base count are special chase pulls.
- **Promos** — organized-play, prerelease and Nexus Night promo printings are limited and often sought-after.
- **Playability** — a card that defines the **[current meta](/decks)** holds value because players need playsets of it.

On RiftCompare, each of these printings is labelled in the card's name (e.g. *(Alt Art)*, *(Signature)*, *(Promo)*) so you always know exactly which version you're looking at.

## Buying and selling chase cards safely

- **Compare across stores** — high-value cards have the widest price spread, so comparing saves the most here. Open any card to see **every store's price** sorted cheapest-first.
- **Mind the condition** — Near Mint (NM) is the benchmark; played copies should cost noticeably less.
- **Buy the English print** unless you specifically want another language — foreign copies are cheaper but aren't the same card.
- **Check the exact printing** — make sure you're buying the alt-art / signature / promo you actually want, not the base card (or vice versa).

Want to find your grail? **[Browse every Riftbound card](/browse)** and sort by price, or read our **[guide to where to buy Riftbound cards](/guides/where-to-buy-riftbound-cards)** for the best place to buy in your region.`,

- **[Compare sealed products](/sealed)** — booster boxes, packs, Proving Grounds and more, priced across shops.

## Tier 1 — the decks to beat

- **Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman** (Body/Calm) — the defining aggro-tempo deck: cheap units backed by combat tricks to close games fast.
- **Irelia, Blade Dancer** (Calm/Chaos) — flexible tempo with a deep spell package that snowballs the board.
- **LeBlanc, Deceiver** (Mind/Order) — go-wide midrange that floods cheap units and converts with value.

## Tier 2 — strong and popular

- **Diana, Scorn of the Moon** (Chaos/Mind) — spell-tempo built around burst finishers like Moonfall.
- **Fiora, Grand Duelist** (Body/Order) — wide, aggressive units that duel down blockers and race.
- **Vex, Gloomist** (Calm/Chaos) — evasive threats plus a deep trick suite to dominate combat.

    tags: ["beginner", "deckbuilding"],
    body: `New to Riftbound deckbuilding? A constructed deck is made of a few distinct parts. Here's how the current tournament lists are put together.

## The parts of a deck

- **Legend (1)** — your identity card. It sets your deck's direction and which Champion you build around (e.g. *Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman*).
- **Champion (1)** — your signature unit, tied to your legend (e.g. *Master Yi, Tempered*).
- **Main deck (~40 cards)** — your **Units**, **Gear** and **Spells**. This is where most of your strategy lives.
- **Runes (12)** — your resource cards. Their colours must match your deck's **domains**.
- **Battlefields (3)** — the locations you contest during the game.
- **Sideboard (up to 8)** — extra cards you can swap in between games at tournaments.

Add it up and a full tournament list is **64 cards** (56 in the main deck plus the sideboard).

## Domains and runes

Riftbound has seven domains — **Fury, Calm, Mind, Body, Chaos, Order** and **Colorless**. Most competitive decks commit to **one or two** domains (for example *Master Yi* is Body/Calm, while *Irelia* is Calm/Chaos). Your 12 runes are split to match those domains, which is how you reliably cast your cards.

## Building on a budget

A deck's cost is dominated by a handful of chase cards — the commons, runes and battlefields are cheap. On every **[meta deck page](/decks)** we show the build cost broken down card-by-card and priced across Australian stores, so you can see exactly where the money goes and where to save. Want to tweak a list? Open it in the **[Deck Builder](/deck)** to re-price your own version.

## Singles vs sealed

- **Singles** are individual cards — the cheapest way to get exactly what your deck needs. Browse them in our **[card database](/browse)**, where each card shows the lowest live AU price and links straight to the store.
- **Sealed** product (booster boxes, packs, Proving Grounds, Nexus Night packs) is better for opening and collecting. Compare it on the **[Sealed Products page](/sealed)**.

## Why our prices are accurate for Australia

Many overseas-hosted stores quietly show prices in the wrong currency depending on where their server thinks you are. We always request the **Australian** price from each store, so the numbers you see are what you'd actually pay locally — no surprise currency conversion at checkout.

## Tips for the cheapest basket

1. **Check the build cost on a deck page.** It already finds the cheapest copy of each card across every store we track.
2. **Watch shipping.** A card that's 20c cheaper isn't a win if it adds postage from a separate store — we show an estimated shipping figure per shop.
3. **Use the [forum](/forum).** Other AU players list cards for sale (often below retail), and you can post a want-to-buy for anything you're chasing.

We currently compare a wide range of Australian stores plus eBay AU, and we add more regularly. If your favourite shop is missing, let us know via [contact](/contact) — this guide will grow as coverage does.`,
